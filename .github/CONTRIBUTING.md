# You're Awesome!

Developer patches are essential for improving this code base. We simply can't thank you enough. I want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that get things working in your environment. There are a few guidelines that are recommended for contributors to follow so that I have a chance of keeping on top of things and merging your Pull Request.

### Got a question or problem?

If you have a question how you should / could use Gramophone, checkout this projects wiki which is open to external collaboration. Otherwise, please feel free to open up an issue.

### The GPL v2 and above.

Both WordPress and Bootstrap licence their projects under this licence, and therefore Gramophone inherits it. Any contributions you make to this project will also fall into this licence (GNU General Public Licence v2). If there is an issue with this, please consider withholding your pull request... but we'd still love you to contribute!
