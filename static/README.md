<h1 align="center"><i>Static Assets</i></h1>

The `static/` sub directory is for static assets. Static assets are <i>assets</i> that don't change over time. This is an umbrella term for your stylesheets, JavaScript & friends, and of course images. Although you should add more and rename them to suit your workflow and stack choice, BigBooty ships with 4 main folders:

  - `css/` ~ For stylesheet based files
  - `fonts/` ~ For custom fonts
  - `images/` ~ For images
  - `js/` ~ For files containing Javascript, TypeScript, Elm, etc

To hook the assets to the theme, add / alter <a href="https://github.com/pjhampton/BigBooty/blob/master/config/enqueue.php">//config/enqueue.php`</a>.
