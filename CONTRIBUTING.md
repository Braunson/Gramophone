In particular, this community seeks the following types of contributions:

- ideas: participate in an Issues thread or start your own to have your voice
heard

## Conduct

Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean, rude or patronising.
Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of values and
circumstances. We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment" as
including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept,
please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that
excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
